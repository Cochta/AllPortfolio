I'm a software & game developer based in Geneva, Switzerland.

I enjoy creating algorythms and all the backend code for applications, games or anything else.

I speak 4 languages: French, Russian, English and German.

My primary strengths are in C# and C++

I am a fast learner and I love to discover and learn new languages and technologies.
