I completed my military duty and rose to the rank of lieutenant, I also obtained the Level 1 leadership certificate for officers.

Here are some of the skills that I learned:

- Training in leadership and methodological skills
- Strengthening social skills
- Practical experience in everyday military life
- Capturing and structuring complex problems under high temporal and physical pressure
- Developing and implementing useful, targeted solutions
